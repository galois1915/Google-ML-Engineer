## Module 1: Introduction to the course
### Introduction
"TensorFlow on Google Cloud" is a course that teaches you how to design and build machine learning models using TensorFlow 2.x and Keras. You will learn about the key components of TensorFlow, manipulate data using the **tf.data** library, create models using the **Keras API**, and train and deploy models at **scale with Vertex AI**. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to build and improve machine learning models using TensorFlow on the Google Cloud platform.
